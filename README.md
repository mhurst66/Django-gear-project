## Introduction
This project was an opportunity to create a full CRUD app with Django and Python, this app is a reprise of my unit 2 project. Part of my future plans include building out a Django back end and coupling in a different front end but was constricted due to time constraints.

## Project Planning
Most of the planning that went into this project was how best to combine the various applications we had made in class or during homework, and then some CSS updates to make things look on brand to the band. I was also able to set up some code to change the icons depending on the type of gear selected.

## App Functionality
Guest users can only see the landing, about, and signup pages. Registered users can use full CRUD on all types of gear. Registered users can also see just a list of the gear they use.

## Future Goals
I want to create a guest user landing page where they can see pictures of the gear in action caroseul style, with a blurb about the band, and an area with a calendar for gigs along with contact information.
When a guest clicks on a picture they are taken to a detail page about the gear and who plays it.
Registered users will have the same fuctionality
